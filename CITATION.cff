title: "Electromagnetic Counterpart Lightcurve Toolkit for AGN-Embedded BBH Mergers"
abstract: "Simulates electromagnetic emission from binary black hole mergers embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks. Evolves jetâ€“cocoon systems, estimates jet power, and computes multiband lightcurves across optical and near-infrared bands."
